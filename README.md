### HOW TO

1.  Install graphviz (must do all steps).
    1.  https://graphviz.org/download/#windows
    2.  pip install graphviz
    3.  make sure graphviz's dot.exe is in your $PATH
2.  If you wish to see the tkinter interface go with _main.py_, else go directly to _tp3.py_'s main function.
3.  the results show up in the console, I haven't got around to updating that.
